# Kaggle-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis

The following project is used to gain a better understanding of Data Visualization and Wrangling methods using Python's Matplotlib, Pandas and Seaborn libraries. 
In addition, to help identify similar customer behaviours, a K-Means algorithm was developed to group similar dynamics between target groups. 

The report and findings is as below:

Overall:
- There are greater number of females that attend the mall compared to males, a difference of 24.
- There is a greater likelihood that people who go to the mall are aged between 30 and 32 years old.
- Males on average have higher incomes but lower scores compared females with lower incomes and higher spending scores


Majority 50%:
- of lower income males range in ages between 29 and 59 whilst females range between 27 and 49 years old.
- of higher income males range in age 30 and 41 whilst females range between 32.5 and 41 years old.
- of average income males range in age between 27 and 48 whilst females range 28 between 48 years old.


Regarding the majority 50% of spending scores:
- high spending score males are aged between 27 and 35 compared to females aged between 27 and 33.
- low spending score males are aged 34 and 53 whilst females are aged between 36 and 49.
- medium spending score males are aged between 26 and 59 whilst females are aged between 28 and 50.


The highest income and spending scores for:
- Males are 137 and 97.
- Females are 126 and 99.


Whilst the lowest income and spending scores for:
- Males are 97 and 1.
- Females are 99 and 5.


As for the number of each group:
- Amongst females and males, the majority have lower incomes.
- There's a greater number of women who have average incomes compared to males
- There's a greater number of females with mid spending scores compared to males.
- Also, there's a greater number of females who spend more than males.


Suggestions
- Have shops aimed with relatively cheap and reasonable prices.
- Have shops aimed more towards females as there are greater number of them to males.
- Include services/goods/shops which cater towards adults e.g. appliances, cafes, groceries, general stores etc.
- To improve marketability of higher-end shops, aim towards females using shops such as clothing, jewelry etc.
